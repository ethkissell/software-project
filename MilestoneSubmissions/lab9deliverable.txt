Application Name: YouTube Wrapped

Application Description: Using YouTube's, (possibly Instagram's, X's, and other apps as well) Data APIs we will collect data from the user and compile a Spotify wrapped-esque presentation of data for the user; presenting them with information such as: most watched channel, time spent watching videos, etc. We can also add general information such as most liked video/post, fastest growing channels, etc.

Vision Statement: For YouTube users, Who want to know more about their habits on YouTube. The YouTube Wrapped can help raise the popularity of YouTube and make use of the online “hype” generated by Spotify-wrapped posts. Unlike YouTube Rewind, our product is more individualized and more acceptable amongst modern audiences.
