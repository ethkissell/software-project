# YouTube Wrapped
## Description

Using YouTube's, Instagram's, X's(open to other apps as well) Data APIs we will collect data from the user and compile a Spotify wrapped-esque presentation of data for the user; presenting them with information such as: most watched channel, time spent watching videos, etc. We can also add general information such as most liked video/post, fastest growing channels, etc.
