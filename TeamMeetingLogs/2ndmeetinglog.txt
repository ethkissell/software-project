Meeting #2
04-02-24

Progress: 
Started building databases
Completed user stories and epics, people chose the stories they wanted to work on
Began coding the UIs for multiple different pages, coding is still in early stages
Work done on login, home, and stats pages.

Next Meeting, Decisions Made:
Work more on front end and back end completion
User tests, getting directery structure ready, work on adding more code so we can show physical work during the next TA meeting.

Alternative options discussed:
Suggestion: Specialize on front end or back end over picking up projects randomly

Folow up items and questions:
We should create two seperate epics for lab 10 instead of one, one created by the group and one for individuals.
